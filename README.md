This is a retrospective of a sprint that we did during CS-250

The way to interpret user needs is to first communicate with the user so you know what their needs are. There are many differnt ways to do this including user reviews, meetings with potential users, etc. After learning what the user wants/needs, then it is important to write a user story, this give you a plan to deliever what is needed and lists what functions need to be created. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The way that I approach developing programs is by coming up with a plan of how I'm going to design my program. After that's done I start working on it but sometimes things need to be changed and thats where agile comes in handy. With the agile methodology, I can plan for the unplanned so to speak and give my self more leeway to change the plan if needed by the program.

What makes up a good team memeber I think is answered by each team differently, but there are a few baseline things that are needed for most teams to be effective. Open communication and willingness to admit mistakes is a huge one. If someone makes a mistake and doesn't say anything, it can lead to way bigger problems down the line. Getting your work done when it is needed is also a big one, or asking for help if you need it as well so your work is not being delayed. I think that most of the things that make a good team member have to do with communication. Communication is very esssential when working together in a team.
